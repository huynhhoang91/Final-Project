How the program should work?
Once you start the client, you will see the application window in front of you. The client allows you to send messages as well as read messages sent by other users. To send a message, enter the text of the message in the special field, and then click send. You will see how your message appeared in the message history. Main features of the app: 

1) the App is multithreaded. This means that multiple clients can run simultaneously using the same server. 

2) the Application allows you to send and receive messages from other users. 

3) the Application shows a list of all users who are currently connected to the same server as the current client. 

4) the Application indicates the date and time when the message was sent
